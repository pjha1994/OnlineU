This is a website for free, curated online courses.

How it's unique:
* It is 100% free. There will be no charge to earn certificates.
* It's long-term goal is to offer comprehensive college-level curriculum for a wide variety of topics.
* Courses will be graded and allow students to go back and improve their grades.
* Courses are grouped by major and ordered coherently, instead of a grab-bag.
* It tracks student progress and will offer automatically graded exams, adding a layer of usefulness to sites like [MIT OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) which have good content but lack these features.
